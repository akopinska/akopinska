Hi there! 👋

🔭 I am currently working on Frontend Mentor challenges using HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design based on designs in Figma.

💪 Over the last 6 months of self-study, I have completed about 30 projects in front-end technologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and still developing my coding skills.

🎯 My goal is to develop my career into a Junior Front-end Developer or Web/Content Publish
